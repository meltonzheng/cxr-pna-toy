### Project: Pneumonia Detection Confidence Visualizer

What you'd build: A tool that takes a chest X-ray, runs it through a pre-trained pneumonia detection model, and visualizes what the model is "looking at" using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). It would show the original image, the model's prediction (normal/pneumonia with confidence score), and a heat map overlay showing which regions influenced the decision.
